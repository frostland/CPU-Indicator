# CPU Indicator #

## The Story ##

One guy, named [Bruno Bellamy][bellaminette] is a hell of a good (French) artist.
One day, for christmas, he decided to create a [special page][bellaminette_noel_97]
(link is in French) on his blog that would feature a girl in underwear, getting totally
undressed when a particular part of the girl would be clicked.

One of his friend, David Odin, had a terrific idea when he saw the page: use the girl to make of her
a CPU Indicator. When the CPU is used, its heat increases, thus forcing the girl to remove her clothes!
When the girl is naked, the CPU is used at its maximum. This idea lead to an open sourced
linux application: [Hot-Babe][hotbabe_official].

A [Windows version][hot_babe_for_windows] of this application exists, but there were no Mac OS X version of Hot-Babe, until now.

**CPU Indicator** is an evolution of Hot-Babe re-created from scratch, specifically for Mac OS X.

## Questions ##

* **Q**: Why create a _public_ GitHub repository for a product which is sold on the App Store?
* **A**: I originally decided to create CPU Indicator for the fun. Then, I thought I could earn some money
from it, but the main purpose of the project is not money. If you want to use my project for free, feel free
to do it! Enjoy being a developer and knowing the ways of the dark force. ;)

If you got any questions/comments not listed above, please contact me through GitHub, or send me a mail, or whatever you want.
If I get the message, I will answer it!

## Special Thanks ##
