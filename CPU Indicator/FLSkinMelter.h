/* This class is used to compute the image drawn at a certain
 * CPU usage, for a given destination size (destSize).
 * A special algorithm is used during the melting to avoid alpha
 * problems (specifically, semi-alpha pixels, when superimposed
 * see their alpha grow though, for a better look, they should not).
 * By default, if not defined, the destSize is set
 * arbitrarily to NSMakeSize(15., 15.).
 *
 * The melting is done lazily: it is computed only when necessary.
